## How to Host the Website

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free)

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Upload all files to the repository
3. Go to Settings → Pages
4. Select the main branch as source
5. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

### Option 2: Netlify (Free)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login
3. Drag and drop the project folder or connect to GitHub
4. Your site will be live instantly

### Option 3: Vercel (Free)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://www.vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login
3. Import your project from GitHub or upload files
4. Deploy with one click

### Option 4: Traditional Web Hosting

1. Upload all files via FTP to your web hosting provider
2. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
3. Access via your domain name

## Local Testing

To test the website locally:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser, or
2. Use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, Gradients)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Prism.js (for code syntax highlighting)

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Features

- ✅ Responsive design (works on mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Smooth scrolling navigation
- ✅ Modern UI with gradient backgrounds
- ✅ Code syntax highlighting
- ✅ Hover effects and animations
- ✅ Clean, professional layout

## Notes

- All code implementations are in Python
- The website is static (no backend required)
- All files are self-contained (uses CDN for Prism.js)
- Ready for immediate deployment to any web hosting service
